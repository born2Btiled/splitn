`splitn` is a CLI app that generates sequences of random digits with given length and every combination being a result of splitting these digits. It's mainly made for testing number parsing applications, especially in the NLU field (e.g. voicebots, chatbots or tools for extracting structural data from text like [duckling](https://github.com/facebook/duckling).
